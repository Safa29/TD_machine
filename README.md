# TD_machine
This git is dedicated to exercice from TD machine for Master 1 university of Tiaret student.
In this git I post the solution of various TDs using python. To be able to run the codes, you'll need a pyhton IDE. I suggest the use of Anaconda with spyder IDE or Pycharm community edition. Eitherway, you'll need Sympy, Numpy and Scipy installed.
